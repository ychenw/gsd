#conditional statements are code structure that enable branching in our code
#that is the program can take a different execution path depending on some
#test.
#the simplest conditional is an if statement that checks whether some condition is true and only then
#executes the lines of code nested below it
#in python this code 'nesting' is determined by tabs
