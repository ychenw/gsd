#before starting make sure to install the following packages:

#A. install pytorch from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

#B. install CLIP following instructions in https://github.com/openai/CLIP
#pip install ftfy regex tqdm
#pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git

#the PIL library is used to open and manipulate images
from PIL import Image

#numpy is used to manipulate vectors
import numpy as np

#the CLIP_helper.py file contains the code to encode text and images using the CLIP model
from CLIP_helper import *

#os is used to interact with the file system (list contents of a folders, construct file paths, etc.)
import os


#in this example we will project the word "cat" along the "animal" and "plant" axes
#then we will use matplotlib to plot the word in the 2D plane defined by the two axes

word = "cat"

axis1 = "animal"
axis2 = "plant"

#encode the word and the two axes
word_vec = encode_text(word)
axis1_vec = encode_text(axis1)
axis2_vec = encode_text(axis2)

#compute the similarity of the word to the two axes using the dot product (this is the cosine similarity since encode_text already normalized the vectors)
x = np.dot(word_vec, axis1_vec)
y = np.dot(word_vec, axis2_vec)

#print the similarity of the word to the two axes
print(f"Similarity to {axis1}: {x}")
