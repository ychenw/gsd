#we define two concepts
#the vertical Y axis will measure the difference between the projection of each phrase along the two concepts (either as word*concept2 - word*concept1 or word*(concept2 - concept1))
#the horizontal X axis will measure the average of the sum of the two projections |word*concept1| + |word*concept2|. Thi will be very small if the word is nrelated to both concepts and large if it is related to one of them or both
